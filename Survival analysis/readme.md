# Survival Analysis
We used data from ``../AllData.zip`` to generate generate a survival probability study. 

In this study, the definition for survival time is the total time it takes for a game to decrease the peak number of players to 10% of the total maximum peak. The timer starts once that maximum is reached. If a game has not reached 10% of the peak, the data is considered censored. An exponential fit was needed in order to eliminate the rapid changes between months. This eliminates unreal sudden deaths.

The Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to generate an estimate of the Survival Probability curve not involving the features.

It is possible to appreciate a rapid slope at the beginning. This suggest that most of the games from the data set fall to the 10% mark within the first 6 to 10 months.

The  Cox's proportional hazards model was used to generate predictions comming from selected features. A total of 47 numeric features were selected. It is well known that to measure the performance of this model, we have to calculate the Harrellâ€™s concordance index (1).

After cross validation, the concordance index was of ~6.5, which means that the model predicts a little better than random.

Although a prediction model is not reliable, we can still observe the prognostic factor, which are the coefficients comming from fitting. If a coefficient is greater than zero, then it contributes to a faster decline in survavility. The effect is the opposite for coefficients less than zero.

Here we report a few of them:

| Feature | `Coefficient` |
|-------|----------------|
|RequiredAge|-0.008818|
|DemoCount|0.025099|
|DeveloperCount|0.127606|
|DLCCount|-0.002965|
|MovieCount|0.065993|
